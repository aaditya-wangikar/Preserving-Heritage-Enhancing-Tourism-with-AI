# Preserving-Heritage-Enhancing-Tourism-with-AI
PART 1. Predict the category of a structure
There are centuries old historical structures that preserve a country's and community's history for future generations and promote tourism opportunities. To improve tourism, a government agency decides to use advanced machine learning techniques to monitor the condition of these historical structures and report if any of them need maintenance. Also, understanding customers (tourists) and their expectations is critical for effective marketing and promotion of tourism. A recommendation engine is an excellent way to supplement existing marketing outreach.
Develop an intelligent and automated AI model using TensorFlow that can predict the 
category of a structure in an image. 

PART 2. Perform exploratory data analysis and develop a recommendation engine
Perform exploratory data analysis and develop a recommendation engine that will help tourists visit their places of interest.
